# Object-in-JavaScript

***First, look at the picture to understand object properties and methods.***

An `object~ in JavaScript is a collection of properties. Each property is made up of a key (also called a name) and a value.

    - The key is a string (or a symbol), and the value can be any type, including primitive values (like numbers or strings), other objects, or functions. 
    - Objects work with defined keys, meaning you can use specific names to access or modify their properties.


In contrast:

An array is a collection of elements where each element has an index (a number starting from 0). Arrays are typically used when you want to store ordered data, and they are dependent on their index.


So, for objects:

Think of them as key-value pairs, like a dictionary.
```js
Example
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false
};
console.log(person.name); // Output: "John"
```
Objects are flexible and can store multiple types of data, making them great for modeling real-world entities.
